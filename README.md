# Practical AIOps

Welcome to **Practical AIOps** — a companion repository for the Cisco Live US 2025 session **BRKOPS-2256: Exploring Practical AIOps Use Cases for Enterprise Networks with Splunk**.

This project is designed to help you sink your teeth into real, actionable AIOps capabilities that you can start applying **today**. We’re giving you the tools, templates, and tutorials to bring AIOps concepts to life inside your own environment — no vague theory, just practical, hands-on guidance.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- 📦 Example use cases for applying AIOps in enterprise networks
- 🛠️ Tooling and scripts for data collection, anomaly detection, and automated remediation
- 📘 How-to guides and implementation walkthroughs
- 🚧 Information about access for the **AIOps Playground** (Coming Soon!)
- 🤖 Details for **Project ADAPT**: A multi-agent network troubleshooting system

## ⚡Now Available

_**Update 6/30/25:** Complete video playlist added covering all components of enabling telemetry and building a machine learning model_<br>
6/20/25: The slide deck from our presentation at Cisco Live US 2025 is now available for download!_<br>
6/16/25: The initial release of Project ADAPT is now available! You can clone and start experimenting with it via http://cs.co/adapt-ai

## 🚀 Coming Soon

We're just getting started. Here's what’s on the way:

- **🧪 AIOps Playground Lab**
  On-demand lab resources that make it easy to spin up sample networks, trigger fault scenarios, build models for machine learning with Splunk and MLTK, and walk through step-by-step agentic workflows for fault diagnosis and remediation.  Bring to life the scenarios we demonstrated in our session from Cisco Live US 2025.
  _→ Remote labs and tutorials launching week of 7/7._
- **🧪 Model-driven Telemetry and Machine Learning Lab**
  We'll be hosting instances of Scott's walk-in lab from Cisco Live 2024 with a super-detailed lab guide to help you explore the step-by-step process of configuration model-driven telemetry and machine-learning in Splunk.
  _→ Remote labs and tutorials launching week of 7/7._
- **📈 Splunk MLTK Use Cases Tutorial**
  Full-length walkthrough of setting up MLTK for anomaly detection.
  _→ Launching week of 6/23._
- **📞 Model-driven Telemetry Concifugration Tutorial**
  Full-length walkthrough of setting up model-driven telemetry between Cisco network devices and Splunk
  _→ Launching week of 6/23._
- **📺 Cisco Live Presentation Recording**
  The recording of "Exploring Practical AIOps Use Cases for Enterprise Networks with Splunk" from Cisco Live US 2025
  _→ Available in early July._
