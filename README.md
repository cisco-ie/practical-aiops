# Practical AIOps

Welcome to **Practical AIOps** — a companion repository for the Cisco Live US 2025 session **BRKOPS-2256: Exploring Practical AIOps Use Cases for Enterprise Networks with Splunk**.

This project is designed to help you sink your teeth into real, actionable AIOps capabilities that you can start applying **today**. We’re giving you the tools, templates, and tutorials to bring AIOps concepts to life inside your own environment — no vague theory, just practical, hands-on guidance.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- 📦 Example use cases for applying AIOps in enterprise networks  
- 🛠️ Tooling and scripts for data collection, anomaly detection, and automated remediation  
- 📘 How-to guides and implementation walkthroughs  
- 🚧 Information about access for the **AIOps Playground** (Coming Soon!)  
- 🤖 Details for **Project ADAPT**: A multi-agent network troubleshooting system

## ⚡Now Available
_**Update 6/16/25:** The initial release of Project ADAPT is now available! You can clone and start experimenting with it via http://cs.co/adapt-ai_

- **🧠 [Project ADAPT](http://cs.co/adapt-ai)** – AI-Driven Action Planner and Troubleshooter  
  A multi-agent system protoype designed to automate network fault diagnosis and mitigation workflows. Built to be extendable, explainable, and experiment-friendly.  
  
## 🚀 Coming Soon

We're just getting started. Here's what’s on the way:

- **🧪 AIOps Playground**  
  On-demand lab resources that make it easy to spin up sample networks, trigger fault scenarios, build models for machine learning with Splunk and MLTK, and walk through step-by-step agentic workflows for fault diagnosis and remediation.  
  _→ Initial labs and tutorials launching week of 6/16._

- **📈 Splunk MLTK Use Cases Tutorial**  
  Full-length walkthrough of setting up MLTK for anomaly detection. 
  _→ Launching week of 6/16._

- **📺 Cisco Live Presentation Recording**  
  The recording of "Exploring Practical AIOps Use Cases for Enterprise Networks with Splunk" from Cisco Live US 2025
  _→ Available in early July._
